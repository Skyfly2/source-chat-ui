# Source Chat Frontend Development Rules

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Material-UI (MUI) components as the primary UI library
- Follow Material Design principles for consistent UX
- Use the custom theme defined in `src/theme/index.ts`
- Implement responsive design using MUI breakpoints
- Use emotion/styled for custom component styling when needed
- Prefer sx prop over makeStyles for component-specific styles

## Component Architecture

- Create small, modular, reusable components
- Use TypeScript for all components with proper type definitions
- Follow the atomic design methodology: atoms -> molecules -> organisms -> templates -> pages
- Place reusable components in `src/components/`
- Place page-specific components in `src/pages/[page-name]/components/`
- Export components from index files for clean imports

## Styling Structure

- Global theme configuration: `src/theme/`
- Component styles: use sx prop or styled components
- Utility functions: `src/utils/`
- Custom hooks: `src/hooks/`

## Source Chat Vision

The application should replicate the core functionality of T3 chat:

- Clean, modern interface with dark theme
- Performance
- User authentication
- Thread management
- Model selection
- Channel/room management
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Modern design with focus on usability and speed

## Code Quality

- No code comments unless absolutely necessary for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo for performance optimization where needed
- Follow React hooks best practices

## File Organization

```
src/
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/           # Basic UI atoms (buttons, inputs, etc.)
│   ├── layout/       # Layout components (header, sidebar, etc.)
│   └── common/       # Common molecules and organisms
├── pages/            # Page components and page-specific components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── utils/            # Utility functions
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
├── theme/            # MUI theme configuration
└── api/              # Axios-based API request functions
└── queries/          # Queries that implement the api functions to be used with hooks
```

## Before Creating New Components

Always check existing components in the codebase to see if they can be reused or extended rather than creating new ones.
Always update the .cursorrules file when style changes or other relevant changes to how things should be structured/designed are mentioned
